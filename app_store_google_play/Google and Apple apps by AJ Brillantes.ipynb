    "\n",
    "Mobile Free is a company that builds mobile apps for Android and iOS users. All the company's apps are in English and are free to download on the App Store and on Google Play. \n",
    "\n",
    "**About this project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the main source of revenue for the company are in-app ads, the profit that the company makes is proportional to the amount of users who engage with those ads. Thus, it is desirable that more users are able to see and engage with the in-app ads to generate more revenue. The purpose of this project is to determine which types of apps are more likely to attract more users. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project was accomplished as part of [Dataquest's](https://www.dataquest.io/) Data Analyst Path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommendation was made for a Travel app profile. It was determined that apps under this genre are quite popular and are able to attract a substantial amount of users. The specific features of the app recommendation, which include showing local tourist destinations and generating itinerary options, were selected due to minimal competition among the apps for both the App Store and Google Play markets. This can boost chances for user attraction and, subsequently, revenue generation."

    "One observation from the list of Android travel apps is that quite a number of them have significant amounts of installs.

Apps focused on specific locations are also on the list, such as Florida Travel Guide and Santa Fe Map and Walks. \n",

Despite the greater number of travel apps here, there isn't much competition present with World Travel Guide by Triposo being one of the few. The recommendation has a chance of working also since, as observed, Google Play has a good mix of apps for leisure and entertainment and apps for practical purposes."

    "# Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis conducted on apps for both the App Store and Google Play, a recommendation for a Travel app profile was made. It appeared to be a viable option as apps for Travel are quite popular for both iOS and Android users. The specific recommendation also has a chance of standing out as there is not much competition for its particular niche. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile Free can build an app that allows travelers to check local tourist destinations for a specific area. They can input a certain location or select from available locations in the app. The app can then recommend popular attractions in the specified location, complete with a description, reviews, pictures, and things to do per destination. Filters, such as budget or price, popularity ratings, proximity from the location, among others, can be used to cater the results towards the specific needs of the traveler. An automatic itinerary generator can then show various itinerary options based on the user input. \n",
    "\n",
    "If user response is positive, additional features can be added. Instead of having to rely on third party apps, Mobile Free's app can also recommend accommodation and travel packages for the user while also accounting for filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the Validation Strategy, the app will first be tested in Google Play. Depending on user response and profitability, the app can be improved and eventually added to the App Store. \n"
