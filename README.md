# Data Analyst Portfolio

A repository of data analyst projects demonstrating skills I have learned so far. These include Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization using **Python**, and Querying a Database with **SQL (SQLite)**. Some projects were accomplished as part of Dataquest's Data Analyst Path. The projects are presented in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files. 

For some projects, there are internal links directing the viewer to specific parts of the notebook. As of this time (11/26/2020), some of these links are not supported 
by GitHub. An issue has been opened [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/1330). I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause the viewer. 

**Python Libraries Used**: pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, Folium, geopandas
